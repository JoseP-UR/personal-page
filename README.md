This is a work in progress for a personal page (with a blog) made with the intent of learning several technologies.

This project runs on nextjs, and uses chakra-ui and threejs.

This is still a work in progress and has several incomplete and unoptimized sections.

The blog will only fetch and list posts from the blog api, management and post creation will be done by a dashboard separated from this page.

It will support comments in the future.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
